DDCA on Saturday filed defamation suits in Delhi High Court against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and BJP MP Kirti Azad for allegedly making defamatory remarks against it regarding its functioning and finances.
“We (DDCA) have filed civil defamation suits against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Kirti Azad seeking Rs 2.5 crore as damages from each of them for their defamatory remarks against us,” DDCA treasurer Ravinder Manchanda told PTI.
Advocate Sangram Patnaik also confirmed that the defamation suits have been filed seeking Rs 2.5 crore damages against both of them.
He further said that the allegations against Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) regarding financial irregularities and corruption in selections at the junior level were “maligning the image” of the cricket body.
Kejriwal and five others of his party have already been dragged to the high court by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for issuing allegedly false and defamatory statements against him and his family members.
Jaitley has sought damages of Rs 10 crore from them. Apart from this, the six Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders are also facing a criminal defamation case filed against them in the trial court by the minister.
